# Eye Blink Detection Using Deep Learning for Eye Safety
## 📌 Overview
**Eye Blink Detection Using Deep Learning** is a workplace wellness tool designed to protect the eye health of digital workers.  
By monitoring blink rates during short, randomized 1-minute intervals, the system detects reduced blinking — a common cause of eye strain, dryness, and discomfort.
This project aligns with **UNITED NATIONS Sustainable Development Goal 3: Good Health and Well-being** by promoting preventive eye care in the workplace.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Employees who spend long hours in front of computer screens often forget to blink at a healthy rate, leading to:
- Eye irritation
- Digital eye strain
- Headaches
- Potential long-term vision issues
---
## 💡 Solution
Our **MobileNetV2-based deep learning model**:
- Randomly monitors employees for 1-minute intervals (no full-day tracking)
- Counts blinks to assess eye health
- Generates **daily/weekly eye health reports**
- Runs over the organization’s **LAN server** to maintain privacy
